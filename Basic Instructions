Don't directly work on the master branch first clone/fork it to your system then create a push request for the changes.
While creating a push request be detailed about your changes.
Use BRACKETS as your goto HTML Editor as it allows the user to get a live view as the developer is creating.
(P.S. You can use any editor as per your Familiarity with the latter.)
Thanks.
